            <h2>Welcome to Our Swedish Haven</h2>
            <p>Step into Fika Coffee Shop and experience the heart of Swedish culture. More than just a café, 
            we're a place where tradition meets community, where every cup tells a story, and where the 
            timeless art of <em>fika</em> comes alive.</p>

        <section class="fika-concept">
            <h2>What is Fika?</h2>
            <p><strong>Fika</strong> (pronounced "fee-ka") is a cherished Swedish tradition that goes far beyond 
            a simple coffee break. It's a moment of pause in our busy lives—a time to slow down, connect with 
            others, and savor life's simple pleasures. Whether shared with friends, colleagues, or enjoyed in 
            peaceful solitude, fika is about being present and finding joy in the everyday.</p>
            
            <p>At our café, we honor this beautiful tradition by creating a warm, welcoming space where 
            conversations flow as smoothly as our carefully brewed coffee, and where every pastry is baked 
            with the same love and attention that Swedish bakers have perfected for generations.</p>

                <h3>Artisan Coffee Culture</h3>
                <p>Sweden has one of the highest coffee consumption rates in the world, and we understand why. 
                Our coffee is sourced from sustainable farms and roasted to perfection, embodying the Swedish 
                appreciation for quality and craftsmanship in every cup.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Traditional Baking</h3>
                <p>Our bakery showcases authentic Swedish treats like <em>kanelbullar</em> (cinnamon buns), 
                <em>kardemummabullar</em> (cardamom buns), and seasonal favorites like <em>semlor</em>. 
                Each pastry is made using traditional recipes passed down through generations, bringing 
                the flavors of Sweden to your table.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Hygge & Lagom</h3>
                <p>Inspired by Scandinavian concepts of coziness (<em>hygge</em>) and balance (<em>lagom</em>), 
                our space is designed to be your sanctuary. Natural materials, soft lighting, and comfortable 
                seating create the perfect atmosphere for your fika experience.</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded by coffee enthusiasts with deep Swedish roots, Fika Coffee Shop was born from a desire

            world, we all need a place to pause, breathe, and connect—whether that's with a friend over a 
            perfectly brewed coffee or with ourselves over a good book and a fresh cinnamon bun.</p>
            
            <p>Come join us for your daily fika. Experience the Swedish way of finding happiness in life's 
            simple moments, one cup at a time.</p>
